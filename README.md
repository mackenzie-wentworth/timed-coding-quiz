## The Task
For this week's challenge, I was tasked to build a code from scratch to create a timed coding quiz for users to test their knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals. To produce the styling and functionality of the web application, I used JavaScript and CSS with HTML to include the following items:

* Beginning homescreen with instructions and a 'start' button to begin the timed quiz
* Upon clicking the 'start button,' the user is then presented with the first question and the timer begins a countdown from 75 seconds
* When a question is answered incorrectly, then the user is penalized by ten seconds which is subtracted from the timer countdown
* When  the user has answered all questions or the time reaches 0 seconds left, then the quiz is over
* Once the quiz is over, the user is presented with the final score, where they can also type in their intials to save their score
* All scores logged with initials, will be saved to local storage to compare knowledge progress
* When the user refreshes the web page, the quiz will navigate to the beginning homescreen where the user can take the quiz again by clicking the 'start' button


## Mock-Up
